# timesheet_mailed
The code here is to automate keyboard and mouse click events to download timesheet and mail it.
The code is host and MacOS specific so can't be used on anyother urls and operating system.
Modules: PyAutoGui, datetime, time.
Code is MacOS specific because of keyboard shortcuts used here.
key_simulation is the main file and prev_week program is used to get start and end date of last and week before last, these values are used in naming the file.
Code won't work as credential file isn't uploaded on purpose.
Hosts: beeline, gmail.
